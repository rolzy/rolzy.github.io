I am a software engineer based in Brisbane, Australia. I am currently working on

After graduating from the University of Queensland with a Bachelor of Mechatronic
Engineering in 2018, I have been working predominantly in the field of machine 
learning, DevOps and MLOps. 

I am currently studying Masters of Data Science at the University of Queensland.
